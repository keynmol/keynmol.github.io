description: A conversation with an old friend of mine where we spend almost 2 hours exploring some of the new features of Scala 3

My old friend [Artem Pyanykh](https://twitter.com/artem_pyanykh) coerced me into recording
a video with him about the new things I personally find exciting about Scala 3. 

His gift for my birthday was a condenser microphone, so I got the hint.

Artem hasn't done any Scala in a few years (and I haven't done any Scala 3 on any meaningful scale), so we decided to go for a more
exploratory conversation about features - with live coding and little to none
prepared code.

Ergonomics of some features I discovered during the video itself, which 
was interesting.

We also looked in the generated bytecode a few times to make sure the premise
of the features is delivered.

Some of the topics we discussed are:

* Starting with Scala 3 vs Scala 2
* Opaque types
* Enums
* Optional braces syntax
* Union types
* Strict equality
* Top-level definitions
* And a lot of general nonsense here and there :)

Hope you enjoy it. Part II is in the works, where we're going to focus on implicits re-design
and some of the other new features.
