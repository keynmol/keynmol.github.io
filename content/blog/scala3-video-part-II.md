description: Second part of conversation with my friend Artem, this time about Scala 3 implicits (=givens)
where I try to convince him to abandon PTSD and return to Scala

---

Here we are again, trying to convince [Artem Pyanykh](https://twitter.com/artem_pyanykh) to abandon
his implicits-induced PTSD and come back rest his head at the Scala 3 loins.

This time we talked about

* Scala 2 implicits
* Givens
* Extension methods (and various ways to add them)
* Improvements in compiler errors
* Conversions
* Given imports
* Implicit functions and `NotGiven`

We also looked at the bytecode (using a [script](https://gist.github.com/keynmol/c3ceb91c08c50f0b6c56068514c2021a) I was asked to publish) of how extension methods get added.

The video is long but there are time codes
